## About me

I am the co-founder of [PediaMed AI](https://pediamedai.com/), a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing AI technologies for pediatrics. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the [Health Care Engineering Systems Center](https://healtheng.illinois.edu/) at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. James M. Rehg](https://rehg.org/) and [Prof. Jimeng Sun](https://www.sunlab.org/).

Before starting my Ph.D., I gained industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer at [SambaNova Systems](https://sambanova.ai/) and [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/about.html), where I worked on cutting-edge AI solutions for autonomous driving and image/video generation. My research focuses on developing innovative AI-driven approaches such as Vision Language Models, Diffusion Models to improve both autonomous driving and healthcare.

❗I am looking for Research Intern opportunities in the 2025 Summer and 2025 Fall.
